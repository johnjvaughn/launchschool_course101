1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
#casual
get 2 numbers in method's arguments or from user
add them and save in a variable
return or print the result
#formal
START
#given 2 integers called "number1" and "number2"
SET result = number1 + number2
PRINT or RETURN result
END

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
(assuming not using join method)
#casual
iterate through the array of strings, and concatenate each one to a saved big string
return the big string
#formal
START
#given array of strings called "strings"
SET iterator = 1
SET bigstring = new empty string
WHILE iterator < length of strings array
  SET current_string = value within strings at space "iterator"
  concatenate a copy of current_string onto end of bigstring
  iterator = iterator + 1
return bigstring
END

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
#casual
iterate through the array of integers
every other integer is pushed on to a new array  of integers
the other integers are simply skipped
#formal
START
#given array of integers called "numbers"
SET iterator = 1
SET newnumbers = new empty array
WHILE iterator < length of numbers array
  SET current_num = value within numbers at space "iterator"
  IF iterator is even
    add current_num to end of newnumbers array
  iterator = iterator + 1
return newnumbers
END
